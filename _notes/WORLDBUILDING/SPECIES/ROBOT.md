100% robot! see [[Cyborg]] if u want them


each robot when made has a basic morality rating (BMR), a personality rating (PR), a basic purpose (BP) and a jailbreaking seal (JS)

the lower the BMR is, the more "moral" and "good" the robot's views are (0.5 = centre)

the PR is a string determined by the robot's personal and politic views and bias that can be translated into words using a program (the string is actually completely random LOL!!) 
- If the PR is 0 then it has no personality and just says/does its BP


the BP determines the robots job. If it doesn't do its BP then u can refund it or whatever. eg. INFORMANT, CLEANER, FIGHTER etc.

the JS just means that a robot hasn't been tampered with 1 = non tampered, 0 = tampered
