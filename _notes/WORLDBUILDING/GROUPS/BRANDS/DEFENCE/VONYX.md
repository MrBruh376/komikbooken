Make shields


CEO: [[Morris Vanguard]]
CFO: [[Josef Herdd]]

each shield is made up of plasma "nodes", and if a node is shot or hit enough, it breaks but can be repaired.

Each node is as strong as each other, so you want loads of little nodes

each shield is a ball that you can put in a [[VONYX Wristband]]. When powered, the plasma emerges from the ball and thats that.
